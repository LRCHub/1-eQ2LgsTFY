[00:01.52] Christmas time
[00:04.16] You know what my favorite part about Christmas time is, my friend?
[00:08.50] When Christmas comes... again
[00:23.00] 
[00:15.47] Who knows what next year holds
[00:18.94] I only hope that it brings me closer to you
[00:22.87] Under the mistletoe
[00:25.97] Arms together, we're wrapped in the weather
[00:29.42] Of Christmas cheer and joyful tears
[00:32.59] Another reason to be falling in love
[00:36.13] On such a wondrous night, not a hiccup in sight
[00:39.92] There's nothing else I'd want
[00:54.42] 
[00:42.98] Oh, when Christmas comes again
[00:49.62] We'll be sat under a starry sky
[00:53.74] Wishin' it never ends with
[00:58.15] Every second spent
[01:03.74] We've cherished it all
[01:07.29] Before all the lights that turned into
[01:10.70] Christmas comes again
[01:21.20] 
[01:19.49] Like carols and Christmas trees
[01:22.66] A voice from Heaven, so rich in the way that you glow
[01:26.77] A person that's meant for me
[01:29.63] You're the reason I never needed the snow
[01:33.64] The soul that we bring into the season
[01:39.14] On such a wondrous night, not a hiccup in sight
[01:42.83] There's nothing else I'd want
[01:57.33] 
[01:46.37] When Christmas comes again
[01:52.09] We'll be sat under a starry sky
[01:56.20] Wishin' it never ends
[02:00.04] Oh, with every second spent
[02:06.21] We've cherished it all
[02:09.78] Before all the lights that turned into
[02:13.07] Christmas comes again
[02:17.08] Oh, oh, oh, no, no, no
[02:24.87] Uh, oh, no, no
[02:31.87] 
[02:27.73] When Christmas comes again
[02:33.51] We'll be sat under a starry sky
[02:37.74] Wishin' it never ends, oh
[02:41.80] With every second spent
[02:47.72] We've cherished it all
[02:51.04] Before all the lights that turned into
[02:54.65] Christmas comes again
[03:05.15] 
[02:59.04] Oh-oh, oh-oh
[03:01.12] When Christmas comes again
[03:09.77] Yeah
